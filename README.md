# Java-Module-3-HashSet-Books
Write a program that will store a set of several objects representing books in the HashSet.
Each book should have a title, author and year of publication.
Also, don't forget to define the hashCode() and equals() methods for your books.
Then, using the for-each loop learned in the previous module,
display in the console window the titles of all books in the collection that were published before 2010.
